      "stage1_cates": "Based on their high-level methodology, the five solutions can be classified into four distinct groups.\n\n### **Group 1: Direct Trigonometric Derivation**\nThis group includes solutions that directly prove the relationship between the angles by manipulating trigonometric expressions using standard identities.\n\n*   **Solutions in this group:** Solution 1, Solution 3\n\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    Both Solution 1 and Solution 3 tackle the problem using the core principles of trigonometry. They start with the given tangent values and use identities to derive the final relationship.\n    *   **Solution 1** uses the tangent addition formula (`tan(α + β)`) to find a relationship between `α + β` and `α`.\n    *   **Solution 3** uses the sine double-angle formula (`sin(2α)`) and shows it is equal to `cos(β)`, then uses a co-function identity to relate `2α` and `β`.\n    Although they use different specific identities, their fundamental approach is identical: a direct algebraic proof within the framework of trigonometry.\n\n### **Group 2: Verification by Substitution**\nThis group contains solutions that do not derive the relationship from scratch but instead verify the correct answer from a list of potential options.\n\n*   **Solutions in this group:** Solution 2\n\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    Solution 2 follows a \"trial-and-error\" or \"plug-and-check\" strategy, which is common in multiple-choice question contexts. It calculates a known trigonometric value for `β` (specifically `sin(β)`) and then systematically calculates the sine of the expressions given in the answer choices until it finds a match. This method verifies a pre-existing answer rather than deriving it, making its overall strategy fundamentally different from a direct proof.\n\n### **Group 3: Complex Number Representation**\nThis group consists of solutions that transform the trigonometric problem into an algebraic problem in the complex plane.\n\n*   **Solutions in this group:** Solution 4\n\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    Solution 4 is unique in its method. It represents the angles `α` and `β` as the arguments of complex numbers (`Z_A` and `Z_B`). The relationship `β = π/2 - 2α` is equivalent to `2α + β = π/2`. In the complex plane, adding angles corresponds to multiplying complex numbers. The solution verifies this by calculating `(Z_A)^2 * Z_B` (or a related product) and showing that the resulting complex number has an argument of `π/2`. This shift from trigonometric functions to the algebra of complex numbers represents a distinct, high-level approach.\n\n### **Group 4: Geometric Construction and Proof**\nThis group includes solutions that create a geometric figure to embody the given angles and then use geometric theorems to solve the problem.\n\n*   **Solutions in this group:** Solution 5\n\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    Solution 5 constructs a specific geometric figure (a cyclic quadrilateral composed of two right-angled triangles sharing a hypotenuse) where the angles `α` and `β` appear naturally. It then applies powerful geometric tools—Ptolemy’s theorem and properties of inscribed angles and isosceles triangles—to uncover the relationship between the angles. This method relies on spatial reasoning and geometric theorems, setting it apart from the purely algebraic and analytical methods of the other groups.",

They start with the given information and algebraically manipulate trigonometric expressions to reach the conclusion.\n\n*   **Solution 1:** This solution directly applies the tangent addition formula $\\tan(\\alpha + \\beta)$ and then uses the inverse tangent identity $\\tan^{-1}(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\tan^{-1}(1/x)$ to establish the relationship.\n*   **Solution 3:** This solution directly manipulates the given sine values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. It recognizes that $\\sin\\beta = \\frac{24}{25}$ can be written as $2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}$, which corresponds to $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = \\sin(2\\alpha)$, and then uses the co-function identity $\\sin(2\\alpha) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-2\\alpha)$ to deduce the result.\n\n**Group 2: Trigonometric Verification / Backward Reasoning**\nThis group contains solutions that utilize trigonometric identities, but their overall strategy involves testing or verifying potential answers, rather than directly deriving the relationship from first principles.\n\n*   **Solution 2:** This approach is characterized by \"trial-and-error\" or \"checking answer choices.\" It converts the given tangents to sines and cosines, and then evaluates trigonometric expressions from the answer choices (e.g., $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-2\\alpha)$) to see if they match $\\sin\\beta$.\n\n**Group 3: Complex Numbers**\nThis group consists of solutions that leverage the properties of complex numbers to represent angles and geometric transformations.\n\n*   **Solution 4:** This solution represents the angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as arguments of complex numbers ($Z_A = 4+3i$ and $Z_B = 24+7i$). It then uses complex number multiplication to relate the arguments, specifically observing that $Z_A^2$ has the same form as $Z_B$ but with its real and imaginary parts swapped, leading to a relationship between $2\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\n**Group 4: Geometric Construction and Theorems**\nThis group includes solutions that rely on constructing a geometric figure and applying established geometric theorems and properties.\n\n*   **Solution 5:** This solution constructs a specific geometric setup involving a cyclic quadrilateral and uses Ptolemy's theorem, along with properties of right triangles and angles in a circle, to derive the relationship between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Grouping:**\n\n*   **Group 1 (Direct Trigonometric Identity Manipulation):** Solution 1, Solution 3\n*   **Group 2 (Trigonometric Verification / Backward Reasoning):** Solution 2\n*   **Group 3 (Complex Numbers):** Solution 4\n*   **Group 4 (Geometric Construction and Theorems):** Solution 5",

The method can be broken down into two main combinatorial calculations followed by a division to find the probability:\n\n1.  **Denominator (Total Outcomes):** Every solution defines the sample space as the total number of ways to distribute 12 distinct items into three distinguishable groups of four. This is calculated using the multinomial coefficient, `12! / (4! * 4! * 4!)`, which equals 34,650. While the notation varies slightly (e.g., `(12 choose 4, 4, 4)`, `C(12; 4, 4, 4)`, or `12! / (4!^3)`), the underlying mathematical concept and the resulting value are identical across all solutions.\n\n2.  **Numerator (Favorable Outcomes):** Every solution identifies the number of favorable outcomes by calculating the ways to distribute 6 specific items (\"black balls\") among three distinguishable people such that one person gets 1, another gets 2, and the third gets 3. This is calculated as `(6 choose 1) * (5 choose 2) * 3!`, which equals 360. This calculation involves choosing the items for the first two groups and then multiplying by `3!` to account for assigning these distributions (1-ball, 2-ball, 3-ball) to the three distinct people.\n\nThe observed differences between the solutions are superficial and do not represent a fundamental divergence in method. These minor variations include:\n*   **Notational differences** for the multinomial coefficient.\n*   **Slightly different phrasing** to describe the steps (e.g., \"permuting the three chosen persons\" vs. \"order the three recipients\").\n*   **Presentation of the arithmetic**: Solutions 1 and 2 use an unusual factorization of the denominator (`70 · 45 · 11`), while Solutions 3, 4, and 5 use the final computed values (`360 / 34650`). This is a difference in calculation style, not in the logical approach to the problem.\n\nSince all five solutions follow the identical logical structure of (Ways to arrange a subset) / (Ways to arrange the total set) and use the same specific formulas to do so, they all belong in a single group.",

      "stage1_cates": "Upon analyzing the provided solutions, it becomes clear that they all employ the exact same high-level approach to solve the problem. The differences between them are superficial, pertaining to notation, explicit calculation steps, or the way intermediate values are presented, rather than fundamental methodological variations.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the common approach shared by all solutions:\n\n1.  **Definition of the Sample Space (Denominator):** All solutions define the total number of possible arrangements for the 12 colored balls (4 Red, 4 White, 4 Blue).\n    *   Solution 1, 2, and 5 explicitly use the multinomial coefficient notation `(12 choose 4, 4, 4)` or `C(12; 4, 4, 4)`.\n    *   Solution 3 and 4 explicitly use the factorial form `12! / (4! 4! 4!)` or `12! / (4!^3)`.\n    *   Crucially, all these expressions evaluate to the same value: 34,650. This consistent definition of the sample space is the first indicator of a shared method.\n\n2.  **Definition of the Favorable Event Space (Numerator):** All solutions define the number of ways to distribute the 6 black balls such that one person receives 1, another receives 2, and the third receives 3. They also account for the distinguishability of the persons.\n    *   All solutions use the calculation `(6 choose 1) * (5 choose 2) * 3!`\n    *   This breaks down to choosing 1 black ball for the first recipient, 2 from the remaining 5 for the second, and then multiplying by 3! to account for the permutations of which *distinguishable person* receives 1, 2, or 3 black balls.\n    *   This calculation consistently yields 360.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation:** All solutions compute the probability by dividing the calculated numerator (360) by the calculated denominator (34,650), which simplifies to 4/385.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll five solutions use an identical combinatorial probability approach. They define the sample space based on the arrangements of colored balls and the favorable outcomes based on the specific distribution of black balls among distinguishable persons, consistently applying the same formulas and interpretations. The minor differences in how they phrase or present these calculations (e.g., `C(N; k)` vs. `N!/(k!...)` or explicitly writing out sub-calculations like `6*10*6`) do not constitute fundamental differences in their overall methodology.\n\nTherefore, all solutions belong to a single group.\n\n**Grouping:**\n\n*   **Group 1: Direct Combinatorial Probability Calculation**\n    *   **Description:** This group encompasses solutions that define the total sample space as the number of distinct arrangements of 12 colored balls and the favorable event space as the number of ways to distribute 6 distinct black balls to 3 distinguishable persons according to specific criteria (1, 2, and 3 balls respectively, with permutations of persons). The probability is then directly calculated as the ratio of these two combinatorial counts.\n    *   **Solutions:** Solution 1, Solution 2, Solution 3, Solution 4, Solution 5.",

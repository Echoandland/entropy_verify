      "stage1_cates": "High-level classification of the five solutions  \n\nGROUP 1 – Classical trigonometric–identity manipulation  \nSolutions 1, 2 and 3  \nAll three start and end entirely within ordinary trigonometry: they interpret the two given tangents as the sides of right triangles, convert them into sines/cosines, and then use addition, double–angle or co-function identities to link β to α.  \n•  Solution 1 applies the tangent‐addition formula directly.  \n•  Solution 2 evaluates the sine of β and of each candidate expression, matching the one that coincides; the checking is different in detail but still nothing more than routine trig identities.  \n•  Solution 3 spots that sin β (or cos β) can be written as 2 sin α cos α and again invokes a standard identity.  \nThe differences lie only in which identity is chosen or whether an answer list is consulted; the overarching method—straight algebraic manipulation of elementary trig formulas—is the same.\n\nGROUP 2 – Complex-number (Euler‐form) argument chasing  \nSolution 4  \nHere the vectors 4+3i and 24+7i are written in polar (re)form, multiplied, and the arguments of the resulting complex numbers are compared.  The key idea is to translate the angle problem into arguments of complex numbers and use multiplicative properties in ℂ—an approach absent from the previous group.\n\nGROUP 3 – Pure Euclidean geometry with a cyclic quadrilateral and Ptolemy  \nSolution 5  \nThis solution constructs a specific quadrilateral, invokes Ptolemy’s theorem, reasons about an isosceles triangle, circum-center and angle chasing in a right triangle to reach β = π/2 – 2α.  The method is fundamentally geometric rather than analytic/algebraic.\n\nSummary of grouping  \n• Group 1: Solutions 1, 2, 3  \n• Group 2: Solution 4  \n• Group 3: Solution 5",

No broad factor-pair search for all three variables is performed.\n\nGroup 3 – “Answer-choice elimination using the identity ab+bc+ca = 247 − (a+b+c)”\n• Solution 5  \n\nCore idea:  \nFirst rewrite the desired sum in terms of a+b+c, then test each multiple-choice option by considering what a+b+c would have to be and arguing that only choice D is viable; finally supply one triple to verify.  This is essentially a choice-by-choice elimination strategy rather than solving the system directly.\n\nAll five solutions are now placed, each in exactly one group, and the grouping is based strictly on their overarching method, not on minor procedural differences.",
